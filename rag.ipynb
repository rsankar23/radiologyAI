Magnification imaging\\nMagnification \\nis a relatively uncommon technique. Probably the \\nmost important example of its use is in magnification mammography (see \\ns\\nection\\n \\n9.3.5). \\nh\\nowever, there are instances when significant magnification \\nis unavoidably present in standard radiographic projections. t\\nhese include the \\nlateral hip and lateral cervical spine projections. Magnification is achieved by \\nincreasing the oi\\nD, which generally requires an increase in the fi\\nD as well. t\\nhe \\nactual magnification achieved varies with depth in the patient. \\nf\\nor example, if \\nthe patient thickness is 20\\n \\ncm, the fi\\nD 140\\n \\ncm and the fs\\nD 80\\n \\ncm, then the \\nmagnification varies between 1.4 at the exit side of the patient and 1.75 at the \\nentrance side. Magnification requires employment of a larger image receptor. \\nf\\nor large body regions this may not be possible. t\\nhe use of magnification has \\nconsequences for dose, spatial resolution and signal to noise ratio (\\nsn\\nR).\\n6.2.4.1.\\n  Dose\\na number of ef fects occur when increasing the oi D. t here is a substantial \\nreduction in the scatter fraction at the image receptor because the scattered \\nrays are generally directed away from the receptor. to maintain the dose to the \\nimage \\nreceptor, an increase in the m\\na\\ns, and hence the patient dose, would be \\nrequired, mainly because of the loss of scatter but also because of the increase in \\nfi\\nD owing to the \\nisl\\n. \\no\\nwing to the reduction in scatter fraction, magnification \\nmay usually be performed without the use of an antiscatter grid. t\\nhis leads to a \\nreduction in m\\na\\ns in proportion to the \\nb\\nucky factor, which is the ratio m\\na\\ns with \\na scatter reduction method divided by m\\na\\ns without a scatter reduction method \\n(see \\ns\\nections 6.3.4 and 6.3.5). t\\nhis factor is typically between about three and \\nsix.\\n6.2.4.2.  Unsharpness\\na\\nny increase in the oi\\nD leads to a reduction in image sharpness due to the \\ngeometric blur of the focal spot, as given by \\ne\\nqs\\n \\n(6.9, 6.11). \\nc\\nonsequently, use \\nof magnification techniques requires a significant reduction in focal spot size, \\ncompared with contact methods. a\\nny improvement in the overall sharpness of \\nthe complete system is generally because of the increase in size of the image \\ncompared with the unsharpness of the image receptor, owing to effects such \\nas light spread for screen film systems and the pixel size for digital systems. \\nMagnification can, therefore, improve spatial resolution, compared with the \\nresult of a simple zoom of a digital image, which enlarges the pixels as well as \\nthe image.'),\n",

Moreover, the small size of the tooth and \\nthe consequent reduced need for X\\n \\nray generation power promotes equipment \\nmobility. t\\nhe effect of the need for equipment mobility also forms a special topic \\nthat is examined in this chapter.\\nQuantification of the composition of the body is another special X\\n \\nray \\nimaging technique.

Most scanners \\nmanufactured since 1992 display real time estimates of the ti\\n and M\\ni\\n.\\nt\\nhe ti\\n is the ratio of the acoustic power output of the scanner to the \\nestimated acoustic power needed to raise the temperature of the tissue being \\nimaged by 1°\\nc\\n.

CT image thresholded at different intensity levels.\\nof course, in most medical image segmentation problems, thresholding \\ndoes not produce satisfactory results. there may be several reasons for this. in \\nnoisy images, there are likely to be pixels inside the structure of interest that \\nare incorrectly labelled because their intensity is below or above the threshold. \\nin MR images, intensity is usually inhomogeneous across the image, so that a \\npair of thresholds that works in one region of the image is not going to work \\nin a different region. lastly, the structure of interest may be adjacent to other \\nstructures with very similar intensity. in all of these situations, more advanced \\ntechniques are required.\\nin some images, the results of thresholding are satisfactory, but the values of \\nthe upper and lower thresholds are not known, a priori. for example, in brain MR \\nimages, it is possible to apply intensity inhomogeneity correction to the image \\nto reduce the effects of inhomogeneity. however, in order to segment the grey \\nmatter or white matter in these images, we would typically need a different pair \\nof thresholds for every scan. in these situations, we require automatic threshold \\ndetection, which is discussed in the next section.\\n17.3.3. Automatic tissue classification\\nconsider the problem where we have to partition an image into regions \\ncorresponding to a fixed number of tissue classes, k. in the brain, for example, \\nthere are three important tissue classes: white matter, grey matter and \\ncerebrospinal fluid (csf). in T 1 weighted MRi, these tissue classes produce \\ndifferent image intensities: the white matter is brightest and the csf is darkest \\n(fig. 17.18). unlike ct, the range of intensity values produced by each tissue \\nclass in MRi is not known, a priori. furthermore, because of MRi inhomogeneity \\nartefacts, noise and partial volume effects, there is a great deal of variability in \\nthe intensity of each tissue class. automatic tissue classification is a term used \\nto describe various computational algorithms that try to partition an image into \\ntissue classes based on statistical inference.'),\n",

Within \\nthis category, there are several distinct subproblems that require different \\nmethodology:\\n ● Accounting for the subject’ s motion: When multiple images of a subject are \\nacquired in a short span of time, the subject may move. \\nf\\nor example, in \\nfMR\\ni\\n studies, hundreds of scans are acquired during an imaging session. \\nto analy\\nse the scans, they must first be aligned, so that the differences due \\nto subject motion are factored out.

Most organs or tissues \\nof the body are unaffected by the loss of a few cells; however, if the number of \\ncells lost is sufficiently large, there is observable harm and, hence, loss of tissue/\\norgan function. a\\nbove a particular level of dose, the so-called threshold dose, the \\nseverity of the effect necessarily increases with increasing dose. t\\nhis threshold \\nvaries from one effect to another. Deterministic effects may occur a few hours \\nor days after exposure (i.e. early skin reaction) or may require months or years \\nbefore expression (i.e. development of cataract of the eye lens).\\ns\\ntochastic effects, on the other hand, are probabilistic effects. t\\nhis means \\nthat the probability of the occurrence of an effect, but not its severity, is a function \\nof dose — the probability increases with dose. t\\nhese effects are assumed to \\nexhibit no threshold dose below which they cannot occur. t\\nhe major stochastic \\neffects of concern at typical diagnostic radiology levels are cancers and genetic \\neffects. t\\nhese are exclusively late effects because they do not appear until years \\nafter radiation exposure.'),\n",

Dose management is implicit in the optimization task. Patient doses can \\nonly be successfully managed if information is available on the magnitude and \\nrange of doses encountered in clinical practice, and DR\\nl\\ns are set using these \\ndata. l\\nocal practice can then be improved by comparison with appropriate DR\\nl\\ns.\\n22.6.1.\\n Population based dose surveys\\na number \\nof countries have rolling programmes of patient dose surveys \\nfor common X\\n \\nray and ct examinations, \\nsuch as the n\\nationwide e\\nvaluation of \\nX\\n ray trends programme in the \\nusa\\n, and the five-yearly reviews of the \\nuk\\n \\nnational patient dose database. t\\nheir findings are published on their web sites \\nand as scientific papers. s\\neveral other countries conduct ad hoc patient dose \\nsurveys, the results of which can be found in the scientific literature. a variety \\nof methodologies (e.g. patient \\nmeasurements, phantom measurements) and dose \\nquantities (e.g. entrance surface air kerma, \\niak\\n) are reported, so care must be \\nexercised when undertaking comparisons.\\nf\\nigure\\n 21.10 shows the uk\\n distribution of X\\n \\nray room mean entrance \\nsurface doses for the anterior–posterior abdomen examination for 1995. t\\nhe \\nshape of the distribution is typical of patient dose surveys: a broad, skewed'),\n",

Bringing \\ntogether the work of 41 authors and reviewers from 12 countries, the handbook \\ncovers a broad range of topics including radiation physics, dosimetry and \\ninstrumentation, image quality and image perception, imaging modality \\nspecific topics, recent advances in digital techniques, and radiation biology \\nand protection. It is not designed to replace the large number of textbooks \\navailable on many aspects of diagnostic radiology physics, but is expected \\nto fill a gap in the teaching material for medical radiation physics in imaging, \\nproviding in a single manageable volume the broadest coverage of topics \\ncurrently available. The handbook has been endorsed by several international \\nprofessional bodies and will be of value to those preparing for their certification \\nas medical physicists, radiologists and diagnostic radiographers.')]"
